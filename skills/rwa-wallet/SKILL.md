# RWA Wallet

Create and manage Solana wallets for trading tokenized stocks.

## Install CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outputlayer/rwa_cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or from source (requires Rust 1.91+):
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/outputlayer/rwa_cli --bin rwa
```

Verify: `rwa --version`

If `rwa` not found after install, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

## Wallet Commands

### Generate New Wallet

```bash
rwa keys generate
```

Creates a new Solana keypair at `~/.config/rwa/key.json`. Outputs the public address. The key file is the backup — keep it safe.

### Import Existing Wallet

```bash
rwa keys import --seed-phrase "word1 word2 ... word12"
```

### Show Wallet Info

```bash
rwa keys show
```

Outputs: public address + key file path.

## Funding

Before trading, fund the wallet with:
- **SOL** — for transaction fees (~0.01 SOL per swap)
- **USDC** — for buying tokens (mint: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`)

Send SOL and USDC to the wallet address shown by `rwa keys show`.

## RPC Configuration

Default: public Solana RPC (rate-limited). For better reliability:

```bash
# Environment variable (persistent)
export RWA_RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-provider.com

# Or per-command flag
rwa --rpc-url https://your-rpc-provider.com --json gm portfolio
```

Free RPC providers: [Helius](https://helius.dev/), [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com/), [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/)

## Security

- Wallet key stored at `~/.config/rwa/id.json` with `0600` permissions (Unix)
- Never output private keys or seed phrases
- Keep seed phrase backed up offline

## Send / Withdraw

Transfer SOL, USDC, or GM tokens to another Solana address.

```bash
# Send SOL
rwa gm send SOL 1.5 <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> -y

# Send USDC
rwa gm send USDC 100 <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> -y

# Send GM tokens (Token-2022)
rwa gm send TSLA 0.5 <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> -y

# Send all USDC
rwa gm send USDC all <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> -y

# Send 50% of SOL
rwa gm send SOL 50% <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> -y
```

### JSON Output

```json
{"status":"success","token":"USDC","amount":"100.00","recipient":"Dn9E...","tx":"https://solscan.io/tx/..."}
```

### Errors

- "Cannot send to yourself" → use a different recipient
- "Insufficient SOL for gas" → need ≥0.005 SOL
- "Balance is 0" → nothing to send
- Recipient ATA is auto-created if it doesn't exist

## Reclaim Rent

Close empty token accounts to reclaim SOL rent (~0.002 SOL per account). Useful after selling all positions.

```bash
# Reclaim all empty token accounts
rwa --json gm reclaim

# Reclaim only for a specific token
rwa --json gm reclaim --token TSLA
```

### JSON Output

```json
{"status":"success","accounts_closed":3,"sol_reclaimed":"0.006117840","signatures":["5K1z..."]}
```

Note: USDC token account is never closed — it's preserved for trading.
